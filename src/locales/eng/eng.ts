    I called it sword, because I believe that when you read the bible and understand what is written, that is the time it becomes a sword. Reading with no
    understanding will not become a sword. And to use the sword we have to follow what is written in the Sword/Bible. Example, It is written in the sword that
    you should pray, so if ye pray, you are using the sword. The bible says obey your parents in the lord, so if we obey our parents, we are using the sword.
    And many more.`,
